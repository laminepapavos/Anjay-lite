Queue Mode
==========

Queue Mode is a special mode of operation in which the device is not required
to actively listen for incoming packets all the time. After sending any message
to the LwM2M Server, the LwM2M Client is only required to listen for incoming
packets for a limited period of time. The LwM2M Server does not immediately
send downlink requests, but instead waits until the LwM2M Client is online.
This mode can be particularly useful for devices that want to switch off their
transceiver and enter a power-saving state when they have nothing to transmit.
This mode is set during registration with the LwM2M Server, using one of the
parameters of the Register operation.

.. note::
    In LwM2M v1.0 Queue Mode is set by Binding resource from LwM2M Server
    object. Anjay Lite does not support it.

The LwM2M Client becomes active when it needs to send one of the following
operations:

    - an Update
    - a Send
    - a Notify

.. note::
    While some LwM2M specification diagrams suggest that an Update operation
    must precede a Send or Notification, Anjay Lite skips this step, reducing
    unnecessary network traffic.

.. note::
    If you implement your own custom network compatibility layer it has to
    support :doc:`reuse last port operation
    <../PortingGuideForNonPOSIXPlatforms/NetworkingAPI/ReuseLastPort>` to make
    Queue Mode work properly.

.. note::
    Code related to this tutorial can be found under
    `examples/tutorial/AT-QueueMode` in the Anjay Lite source directory and is
    based on `examples/tutorial/BC-MandatoryObjects` example.

Enable Queue Mode
-----------------

To enable Queue Mode in Anjay Lite update the configuration structure:

.. code-block:: c

    anj_configuration_t config = {
        .endpoint_name = argv[1],
        .queue_mode_enabled = true,
        .queue_mode_timeout_ms = 5000
    };
    if (anj_core_init(&anj, &config)) {
        log(L_ERROR, "Failed to initialize Anjay Lite");
        return -1;
    }

**How it works**

    - ``queue_mode_enabled = true`` – Enables Queue Mode.
    - ``queue_mode_timeout_ms = 5000`` – Specifies how long after last exchange
      with the LwM2M Server Anjay Lite will switch to offline mode.

It is recommended not to modify ``queue_mode_timeout_ms``. It is set to a lower
value here only to demonstrate faster transitions to offline mode. However,
setting this parameter can be advantageous when you are willing to trade
reliability for energy savings.

If not set manually, ``queue_mode_timeout_ms`` defaults to
``MAX_TRANSMIT_WAIT``, a value defined by the CoAP protocol. This parameter
represents the maximum time a sender waits for an acknowledgment or reset of a
confirmable CoAP message before giving up. Therefore, if we shorten this
interval, retransmissions – and, in the case of a drastic reduction, even the
original messages – sent by the LwM2M Server may not reach the LwM2M Client.

For the default transmission parameters, ``MAX_TRANSMIT_WAIT`` is equal to 93
seconds.

.. note::
    Another way to adjust the time after which Anjay Lite switches to offline
    mode is to modify the transmission parameters via the ``udp_tx_params``
    field from the ``anj_configuration_t`` structure.

Switching to power-saving mode
------------------------------

When Queue Mode is enabled, Anjay Lite automatically switches the client to an
offline state after a period of inactivity. During this time, the device can
enter a low-power mode to conserve energy.

.. note::
    This example uses the POSIX function ``clock_nanosleep`` to simulate
    low-power mode. This call does not reduce the device’s actual power
    usage but illustrates how you can integrate real power management.

First, let's define the callback that will be called when the status of the
server connection changes:

.. highlight:: c
.. snippet-source:: examples/tutorial/AT-QueueMode/src/main.c

    static void connection_status_callback(void *arg,
                                           anj_t *anj,
                                           anj_conn_status_t conn_status) {
        (void) arg;

        if (conn_status == ANJ_CONN_STATUS_QUEUE_MODE) {
            uint64_t time_ms = anj_core_next_step_time(anj);

            // Simulate entering low power mode for period of time returned by
            // previous function
            struct timespec ts = {
                // Warning: unchecked cast
                .tv_sec = (time_t) (time_ms / 1000),
                .tv_nsec = (long) ((time_ms % 1000) * 1000000L)
            };
            clock_nanosleep(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, 0, &ts, NULL);
        }
    }

**How it works**

    - ``ANJ_CONN_STATUS_QUEUE_MODE`` – indicates that the client has switched
      to offline mode and will not receive any new messages.
    - ``anj_core_next_step_time()`` – returns the number of milliseconds until
      the next call to ``anj_core_step()`` is required. Use this value to
      determine how long the device can stay in power-saving mode.


.. note::
    If you call ``anj_observe_data_model_changed`` after putting the device
    into power-saving mode, the time previously returned by
    ``anj_core_next_step_time`` may no longer be valid; in that case, call the
    function again and use the updated time value.

After that update the configuration:

.. highlight:: c
.. snippet-source:: examples/tutorial/AT-QueueMode/src/main.c
    :emphasize-lines: 5

    anj_configuration_t config = {
        .endpoint_name = argv[1],
        .queue_mode_enabled = true,
        .queue_mode_timeout_ms = 5000,
        .connection_status_cb = connection_status_callback
    };
    if (anj_core_init(&anj, &config)) {
        log(L_ERROR, "Failed to initialize Anjay Lite");
        return -1;
    }
