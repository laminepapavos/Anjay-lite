Compiling client applications
=============================

This guide explains how to set up your environment, integrate Anjay Lite into
your application, and build and run tests on Linux systems.

.. note::

   This guide is intended for Linux only and has been verified on Ubuntu 22.04
   and Ubuntu 24.04.

Preparing the Environment
-------------------------

To prevent issues related to external dependencies, install all required
dependencies by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   apt-get update && apt-get install -yq git build-essential cmake

The following tools are not required for building Anjay Lite project itself, but
they may be needed for auxiliary tasks such as testing, documentation generation
or memory analysis.

.. code-block:: bash

   apt-get install -yq python3 python3-pip clang-tools valgrind curl doxygen
   pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt

Integrating Anjay Lite into a Custom Application
------------------------------------------------

Before building and integrating Anjay Lite, it may be necessary to adjust its
compile-time configuration depending on the target platform and desired feature
set. Anjay Lite is designed to be flexible and modular, and many of its features
can be enabled or disabled.

Anjay Lite uses a configuration header to control which features and components
are included during compilation. The default template is provided as
:file:`anj_config.h.in`. There are two ways to provide this configuration:

- Use CMake for automatic configuration:

  - If you integrate Anjay Lite using :code:`find_package`, the
    configuration file will be generated automatically by CMake. You can
    customize it by setting relevant ``ANJ_*`` variables in your
    :file:`CMakeLists.txt` before calling :code:`find_package`. This
    approach requires no manual editing of the ``.in`` file.

- Configure manually:

  If you're not using :code:`find_package`, or building Anjay Lite as part of a
  larger cross-platform project, you can configure Anjay Lite manually:

    - Copy the :file:`include_public/anj/anj_config.h.in` file to the
      ``config/`` directory, and rename it to :file:`config/anj/anj_config.h`.

    - Open the file and:

      - Replace ``#cmakedefine *_SOME_FEATURE`` with ``#define *_SOME_FEATURE``
        to enable a feature.

      - Remove or comment the line to disable a feature.

      - Replace any ``@PLACEHOLDER@`` values.

    - Add the ``config/`` directory to your include path.

Each configuration option is documented inline, with comments explaining its
purpose and possible values. Adjusting these options allows the library to be
tailored for different environments, from full-featured POSIX systems to
minimal bare-metal platforms.

Building on Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To integrate Anjay Lite into your own project on Linux using CMake, you don’t
need to install the library system-wide. Instead, Anjay Lite is set up in a way
that lets CMake use it directly from its source directory. You can include it in
your project by using the :code:`find_package` command. Just make sure to tell
CMake where to find the Anjay Lite sources — for example, by setting the
:code:`anjay_lite_DIR` variable to point to the cmake subdirectory of the Anjay
Lite source tree, as shown below.

When using :code:`find_package`, define the required configuration variables
before calling the command. If no variables are set, CMake uses the default
configuration from the :file:`cmake/anjay-lite-config.cmake` file. CMake
automatically generates the :file:`anj_config.h` file based on the selected
configuration. The file is placed within the include path, so you do
not need to manage it manually. Configuration options are listed and documented
in the :file:`anj_config.h.in` file.

The following is an example :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file that demonstrates how to
build an application with Anjay Lite using a custom configuration:

.. code-block:: cmake

   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.4.0)
   project(MyAnjayLiteApp C)

   # Set custom configuration of Anjay Lite, if required
   set(ANJ_WITH_EXTRA_WARNINGS OFF)

   # Set the path to Anjay Lite CMake config directory
   set(anjay_lite_DIR "<anjay_lite_root>/cmake")

   # Find Anjay Lite package
   find_package(anjay_lite REQUIRED)

   # Define the executable target and its source file(s)
   add_executable(my_application main.c)

   # Link Anjay Lite to the executable
   target_link_libraries(my_application PRIVATE
                         anj
                         anj_extra_warning_flags)

.. note::
    ``anj_extra_warning_flags`` is a CMake **INTERFACE** target that, when the
    compiler is GCC or Clang, injects an extended set of warning flags without
    producing any binaries. Anjay links to it only when the CMake option
    ``ANJ_WITH_EXTRA_WARNINGS`` is enabled (this option is ON by default). You
    can simply add ``anj_extra_warning_flags`` to ``target_link_libraries`` if
    you want compile your sources with the same flags, but it is not required.

Now you can simply build your application:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make -j

Building without including Anjay Lite as a package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are building Anjay Lite as part of a larger project or targeting a
non-host platform, you may integrate its sources directly using a custom build
system setup. This approach is suitable for cross-compilation environments,
where using :code:`find_package` is not practical or when CMake is not the
target build system.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Flat build without build system

      Before running this example, it is required to have a directory structure
      similar to following:

      .. code-block:: none

         project/
         ├── main.c
         └── anjay_lite/

      The following example compiles a sample application with the Anjay Lite
      library in a Unix-like environment:

      .. code-block:: bash

         # configuration
         mkdir -p config/anj
         cp anjay_lite/include_public/anj/anj_config.h.in config/anj/anj_config.h.in

         # renaming anj_config.h.in to the anj_config.h
         # edit this file before, as described earlier
         mv config/anj/anj_config.h.in config/anj/anj_config.h

         # building
         cc \
            -Iconfig \
            -Ianjay_lite/include_public \
            main.c \
            $(find anjay_lite/src -name '*.c') \
            -lm

      See :ref:`integrating-anjay-lite` for details regarding config files.

      Final directory structure:

      .. code-block:: none

         project/
         ├── main.c
         ├── config/
         │   ├── anj/
         │   │   └── anj_config.h
         ├── anjay_lite/
         └── <build_artifacts>
         
   .. tab-item:: CMake without find_package

      Before running this example, it is required to have a directory structure
      similar to following:

      .. code-block:: none

         project/
         ├── main.c
         ├── CMakeLists.txt
         ├── config/
         │   ├── anj/
         │   │   └── anj_config.h
         └── anjay_lite/

      .. note::
         
         The configuration files have to be provided manually. See
         :ref:`integrating-anjay-lite` for details.

      The following example :file:`CMakeLists.txt` can be used to build an
      application with Anjay Lite using custom configuration:

      .. code-block:: cmake

         cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.4.0)
         project(MyAnjayLiteApp C)

         # Set the path to the Anjay Lite source directory
         set(ANJAY_LITE_PATH "anjay_lite")

         # Recursively collect all .c source files from Anjay Lite
         file(GLOB_RECURSE ANJAY_LITE_SOURCES
            ${ANJAY_LITE_PATH}/src/*.c
         )

         # Create the library
         add_library(anjay_lite STATIC
            ${ANJAY_LITE_SOURCES}
         )

         # Add include directories
         target_include_directories(anjay_lite
            PUBLIC
               # Anjay Lite public API headers
               ${ANJAY_LITE_PATH}/include_public
               # App-specific configuration headers for Anjay Lite
               ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/config
         )

         # Add your own application source files
         set(APP_SOURCES
            main.c
         )

         # Create the executable
         add_executable(my_application
            ${APP_SOURCES}
         )

         # Link libraries with application
         target_link_libraries(my_application PRIVATE
            # Anjay Lite library
            anjay_lite
            # Math library
            m
         )

      Now you can simply build your application:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir build
         cd build
         cmake ..
         make -j

Building and running Tests
--------------------------

Anjay Lite provides a collection of example applications that serve as practical
starting points for developing your own solutions. It also includes a
comprehensive test suite to support integration and debugging efforts.

Building Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To build all tests, run the following commands from the project root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir build
   cd build/
   cmake ..
   make -j

The top-level :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file acts as a wrapper that organizes all
example and test projects. You can also build individual test suites directly
from their respective directories. For example, to build tests for the
``anj/core`` module:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd tests/anj/core
   mkdir build
   cd build/
   cmake ..
   make -j

All compiled tests binaries are placed in the ``build/`` directory, each within
its corresponding subdirectory.

Running Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After completing the build process, you can run the tests from within the
``build/`` directory by executing the compiled binaries. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   core_tests/core_tests

To run the same tests with Valgrind, use the corresponding ``make`` target with
the ``_with_valgrind`` suffix:

.. code-block:: bash

   make core_tests_with_valgrind

Next Steps
----------

Your development environment is now set up, and all example applications and
tests have been successfully built and executed. You can continue by exploring
specific features, object implementations, or integration workflows described in
the subsequent sections of this documentation.
