## Licensing Notice

### Mandatory Registration for Commercial Use

If you intend to use Anjay Lite in any **commercial context**,
**you must fill in a registration form** to obtain a **free commercial license**
for your product.

**Register** [**here**][anjay-lite-registration].

**Why is registration required?**

We introduced registration to:

- **Gain insight into usage patterns** – so we can prioritize support, features,
  and enhancements relevant to real-world use cases.
- **Engage with users** – allow us to notify you about important updates,
  security advisories, or licensing changes.
- **Offer tailored commercial plugins, professional services, and technical support**
  to accelerate your product development.

For inquiries, please contact: [sales@avsystem.com](mailto:sales@avsystem.com)

## Beta Release Notice

This is a beta release of Anjay Lite and is currently under active development.
While we are making every effort to keep the API stable, changes may still occur
as we refine the library based on testing and user input.

We encourage you to explore the SDK and share your feedback, suggestions, or
issues via our GitHub repository.

## About The Project

Anjay Lite is a streamlined version of our robust [Anjay LwM2M Client SDK][anjay-github],
purpose-built for the most resource-constrained and battery-powered IoT devices.
Designed with ultra-efficiency in mind, Anjay Lite eliminates many abstractions
and embraces a minimalistic architecture that significantly reduces memory and
code footprint. It is purpose-built for highly resource-constrained environments,
including bare-metal devices that operate without an operating system or dynamic
memory allocation.

By offering developers direct, fine-grained control over resource usage and client
behavior, Anjay Lite empowers precision tailoring of LwM2M functionality to the
specific constraints and requirements of embedded applications — ideal for sectors
such as smart water metering, asset tracking, and environmental monitoring.

While Anjay remains the go-to solution for feature-rich, scalable LwM2M
implementations — supporting a broad range of use cases and advanced
capabilities, Anjay Lite addresses a complementary need: delivering lightweight
LwM2M connectivity without compromise on reliability or standards compliance.

The project has been created and is actively maintained by
[AVSystem][avsystem-url].

For more information and a list of supported features, see the
[Anjay Lite Introduction][anjay-lite-introduction].

## About OMA LwM2M

OMA LwM2M is a remote device management and telemetry protocol designed to
conserve network resources. It is especially suitable for constrained wireless
devices, where network communication is a major factor affecting battery life.
LwM2M features secure (DTLS-encrypted) methods of remote bootstrapping,
configuration and notifications over UDP or SMS.

## Quickstart Guide

To build the Anjay Lite project, run:

``` sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

This will compile all the examples that use Anjay Lite, along with the test suite
in the build directory.

### Building and Running a Single Anjay Lite Example

To build and run a specific Anjay Lite example (e.g., from the examples/tutorial/BC-MandatoryObjects
directory), you can follow these steps:

``` sh
cd examples/tutorial/BC-MandatoryObjects
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
./anjay_lite_bc_mandatory_objects <endpoint_name>
```

Replace <endpoint_name> with your desired endpoint name.
