/**
 * Registers a new LwM2M Send request to be sent.
 *
 * If this function returns 0, the finish handler will be called with the result
 * of the operation. A Send request is allowed only if a registration session is
 * active. The request will be processed when possible — if there is no ongoing
 * exchange, only Update messages have higher priority.
 *
 * If multiple Send requests are queued, the oldest one is sent first.
 * Only one Send request is processed at a time.
 *
 * @note Only SenML CBOR provides support for timestamps.
 *
 * @note If @p send_request contains multiple records with the same
 *       path listed more than once, the request will fail when encoded as
 *       LwM2M CBOR — even if the records have different timestamps.
 *
 *       This is because LwM2M CBOR maps resource paths to keys in a CBOR map,
 *       which requires keys (i.e., paths) to be unique. Having duplicate
 *       paths in the encoded structure is invalid and not supported.
 *
 * @note The @p send_request structure is not copied internally.
 *       The pointer must remain valid and unchanged until the send operation
 *       completes and the associated finish handler has been called.
 *
 * @param      anj          Anjay object to operate on.
 * @param      send_request Structure representing the message to be sent.
 *                          Must remain valid until the operation is finished.
 * @param[out] out_send_id  Pointer to a variable where the ID of the new Send
 *                          operation will be stored. May be NULL if the ID is
 *                          not needed. The ID remains valid until the
 *                          associated @ref anj_send_finished_handler_t is
 *                          invoked.
 *
 * @returns 0 on success, a negative value in case of an error:
 *          - @ref ANJ_SEND_ERR_NO_SPACE if there is no space for new request,
 *          - @ref ANJ_SEND_ERR_NOT_ALLOWED if the request can't be sent in
